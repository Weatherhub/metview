# Function split_and_archive:
#
# - prepares ODB data for archiving by splitting it into several files 
#   with data homogenious with regards to analysis date, time and report type,
#   suitable for indexing on MARS Server / ODB Server.
#
# - archives the files,
#
# - verifies the archiving was successfull by retrieving archived files
#   and comparing them to the originals

# Function split_and_archive accepts 3 parameters:
function,of = filter         # SQL to be applied to input files.
            / source         # List of files to be procesed.
            / output_schema, # Template of output files with ODB columns to split 
                             # the data by in curly braces,
                             # e.g. "/odb_root/{andate}/{antime}/{reportype}.odb"
