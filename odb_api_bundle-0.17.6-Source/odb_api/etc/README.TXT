This directory is a copy of /usr/local/lib/metaps/lib/odalib/current/etc/ on ECMWF systems.
made at some point in time and is not being synced regularly.

Additionally, the file rtablel_2031 from directory defined normally in 

  ODB_RTABLE_PATH=/usr/local/apps/odb/CY37R3.001/pgf90/LP64/include

has been copied here - it is required by SQL function RggBox (see TestFunctionRggBox).

The files here are only used for testing purposes - we set ODB_API_HOME to point to parent directory of this one
when we run unit tests on our test machines.
